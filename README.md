Project Overview

The Math Practice Program is a console-based application designed to help users practice fundamental math operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program uses a menu-driven interface and tracks user performance across sessions.

This project was developed as part of a SCRUM-based C++ coding assignment, where functionality was incrementally delivered across three sprints following Agile principles.

Project Objectives

Reinforce understanding of basic arithmetic operations

Demonstrate modular programming using functions and separate files

Apply SCRUM methodology by dividing work into logical sprints

Implement file input/output to persist user statistics

Practice structured, readable, and maintainable code design


Sprint Breakdown
Goal: Allow users to navigate the program and select math operations.

Features:

Program title and main menu display

User input handling with validation

Option selector that routes user choices to the correct function


Sprint 2 – Main Integration & Calculation 1
Goal: Integrate core program logic and implement basic calculations.

Features:

Main integration function to manage program flow

Addition practice function

Subtraction practice function

Problem tracking (attempted vs. correct)

Sprint 3 – Advanced Calculations & File I/O
Goal: Expand functionality and add data persistence.

Features:

Multiplication practice function

Division practice function

Write statistics to a file

Read statistics from a file on program startup

Resume progress across sessions

Technologies Used

C / C++ (procedural programming)

Standard libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, time.h, ctype.h)

File input/output

SCRUM / Agile methodology
