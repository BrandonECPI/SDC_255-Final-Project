Project Overview:

The Math Practice Program is a console-based application designed to help users practice fundamental math operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program uses a menu-driven interface and tracks user performance across sessions.

This project was developed as part of a SCRUM-based C++ coding assignment, where functionality was incrementally delivered across three sprints following Agile principles.

Project Objectives:

Apply SCRUM methodology by dividing work into logical sprints

Practice structured, readable, and maintainable code design


Sprint Breakdown

Goal: Allow users to navigate the program and select math operations.

Sprint 1 – Menu & Option Selector

Features:

Program title and main menu display

User input handling with validation

Option selector that routes user choices to the correct function


Sprint 2 – Main Integration & Calculation 1

Goal: Integrate core program logic and implement basic calculations.

Features:

Main integration function to manage program flow

Addition practice function

Subtraction practice function

Problem tracking (attempted vs. correct)

Sprint 3 – Advanced Calculations & File I/O

Goal: Expand functionality and add data persistence.

Features:

Multiplication practice function

Division practice function

Write statistics to a file

Read statistics from a file on program startup

Resume progress across sessions

Technologies Used:

C / C++ (procedural programming)

SCRUM / Agile methodology
